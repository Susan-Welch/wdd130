    <h2>Susan</h2>
    <p>I am a life long member of the Church. My favorite scripture is Jacob 6:12 O be wise, what can I say more?</p>
    <p>For fun, I play many different musical instruments including piano, tin whistle, and handbells. I enjoy being outside and am often adventuring in the mountains or riding my bike somewhere awesome. As for work, I just started teaching swimming to kids and it turns out that I love it!</p>
    <p> What I like the most about BYU-I is that I can afford it. I am choosing a degree in web design and development because pople are spending most of their lives online and I want to positively affect their experience. It is a pleasure getting to know all of you, good luck! </p>
